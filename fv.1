.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fv
is a wrapper around the file list functions of most common kinds of
archivers and packagers available on *NIX systems. It provides a fast,
easy way to look inside archives without having to remember the arcane
options required by many archiving programs.
.LP
The archive type is determined from the filename suffix, and selects
which archiver program to run.
The archiver's `list archive contents' arguments are given to display
a directory containing the most useful information about the files
within the archive.
.LP
If the program needed to handle an archive type is not available
on the system, the error message \(lqcommand not found\(rq is
displayed it is encountered.  The error message \(lqNot a known
archive\(rq is displayed for unknown suffixes.
.LP
Several archive types do not have common file suffixes, so arbitrary but
unique suffixes are used.  To find the complete list of archive types
and suffixes supported, view the
.B fv
script.
.LP
It is trivial to add more archive types to
.BR fv .
Please contact the author if you know of one not included.
